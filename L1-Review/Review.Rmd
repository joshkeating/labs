```{r L1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#The dataset we are exploring has influenza and pneumonia deaths on a state and national level, over time.
#https://www.healthdata.gov/dataset/deaths-pnuemonia-and-influneza-and-all-deaths-state-and-region-national-center-health

#We will be requiring knitr, dplyr, and ggplot2
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#Read in the dataset
setwd("/home/josh/School_16-17/Q2/info498c/labs/L1-Review/")
data <- read.csv(file = 'flu_deaths.csv')

#Handle NA values
data[is.na(data)] <- 0

#Create one summary table and one plot about two different aspects of the dataset. Include a small paragraph explaining what each table/plot is showing.



```

###Your explanation goes here!
Play around with markdown syntax to create *interesting* and **engaging** text.

```{r table, echo=FALSE}
#Summary Table

```

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
#Plot

```

```{r challenge, echo=FALSE}
#If you are looking for a challenge, try to use the MMWR.Year.Week data to show the number of deaths over time for one season

```
